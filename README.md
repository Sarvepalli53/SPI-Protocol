# SPI-Protocol
This project simulates the SPI protocol on a single FPGA. The Verilog HDl files for the same have been given above, the master has been simulated in the master.v fine and the slave and the interconnection between the master and the slave have been simulated in the loopback.v file. master.tb and loop.tb show the teshbenches for the same.

The simulation and testbench of the protocol with encrypted transmission is given in the files spi_main.v and spi_testbench.tb respectively.
